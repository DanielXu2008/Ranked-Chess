A fun way to play chess 

Features:
- Three different chess AI opponents to play against
- Ranking system based on player performance
- Data saving

Installation:
- Use the package manager pip to install pygame: pip install pygame
- The python package random is also needed.

Bugs:
- The strongest AI can take a long time to play a move, which sometimes causes the pygame window to say "not responding". If this happens, keep waiting until the AI makes a move and the warning should go away.

Support:
- Please contact the developer at dxu5@ocdsb.ca for support or feature requests.
