## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.0+
- Pygame

### Setup
Install Pygame using pip:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

## Notes
- The strongest AI can take a long time to play a move, which may cause the pygame window to display "Not Responding." If this happens, simply wait for the AI to make a move, and the warning should disappear.
